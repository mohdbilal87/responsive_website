# Portfolio Website

**Portfolio Website** is a responsive webpage which links to projects which I have accompalished in the past mainly related to Data Driven Development, hence the logo.

## Main files

All the files are kept under the directory **responsive_website_assignment2.**

Following are the files with their brief description:
<ul>
    <li>index.html: This file structures the content on the webpage.</li>
    <li>css/main.css: This file does the styling of index.html</li>
</ul>

## Markup Checks
HTML markup check done @ https://validator.w3.org/ with No error and Warnings.
CSS markup check done @ http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ with No Error.

## Running the project.
Clone the git repository in your machine and click index.html. Use google chrome dev tools to check for responsiveness in Apple iPad and Google Nexus 5.

For some strange reason: responsiveness check on Apple ipad shows correctly when viewed at 75% or lower. But doesn't scroll all the way down when set to 100%. It shows correctly when viewed in landscape mode in ipad.
